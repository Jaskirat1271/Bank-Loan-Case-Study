# Bank-Loan-Case-Study

This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

This project taught me a number of new things in analytics as mentioned below:
1. Imbalance concept in data
2. Univariate analysis, Segmented variate analysis
3. Bivariate analysis
4. Finding correlations to extract useful data.
